Problem Statement

Create an abstract class Department with one abstract method:
abstract class Department {
Public name: string;
constructor (name) {}
printName(): void { console dept name with appropriate message }
abstract printMeeting(): void;
}

Now extend this abstract class using AccountingDepartment:
class AccountingDepartment extends Department {
//Use department class property and methods here
}
Again create 2 more classes for different department and extend
department class. And then create instance for all and show output using
console
